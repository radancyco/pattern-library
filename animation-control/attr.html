    <td><code>.ac__video</code></td>
    <td>Include this class on all <code>video</code> elements, when present.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>.animation-enabled</code></td>
    <td>This class is applied to the <code>body</code> element on page load. CSS animation will only run when this class is present. Removing it will pause animation. By default, we are putting accessibility first by treating animation as an enhancement.</td>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Video should be delivered as an optimized <code>webm</code> or <code>mp4</code>. The file size should be reduced as much as possible to reduce overall page weight.</li>
    <li>Video should be no longer than 20-30 seconds in length. The shorter the video is, the less of an impact it will have on performance.</li>
    <li>In addition to the pause button, video and CSS animations utilize <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. When a user disables animation in their operating system, the animation will not autoplay, nor will the pause button be present.</li>
    <li>A cookie called <code>AnimationPaused</code> is added or removed when pause button is toggled. This cookie remembers the desired setting on other pages of the site that use the same script and on return visits.</li>
    <li>Video may not autoplay if mobile device is in low-power mode. This is so that battery life is not unnecessarily darined.</li>
