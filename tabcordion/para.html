<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>data-tab-active (Number, Optional):</b> Using a number from "1" up, you can specify which tab should be active on page load. When this attribute is not specified, the first panel will be open by default. A tab must always have at least one panel open.</li>
  <li><b>data-tab-animation (Boolean, Optional) :</b> This attribute will enable animation of the content on page load and when tab or disclosure button are selected. You may customize the default CSS animation or keep what is currently in place.</li>
  <li><b>data-tab-breakpoint (String, Required):</b> Accepts any valid media query for more granular control over when interface needs to change from accordion to tab. Setting the breakpoint in code also allows us to pass in the required roles and ARIA attributes needed for each type of interface. For example, setting <code>(min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1200px)</code> would only allow tabs between these two selected breakpoints. See <a href="#tab-accordion-4">example</a> below.</li>
  <!-- li><b>data-tab-callback (String, Optional):</b> You can use a callback to initiate a function within the disclosed content area on page load and reinitiate the same function on button click. The function will fire when any button in the grid disclosure is engaged with. The value of this data attribute should, of course, be the same as the function you wish to call</li -->
  <!-- li><b>data-tab-collapse (Boolean, Optional):</b> This attribute will ensure that all disclosures are closed. When this attribute is not specified, the first disclosure will be open bu default.</li -->
  <li><b>data-tab-disable-url (Boolean, Optional):</b> By default, the URL will always change to reflect selected page fragment. This is recommended behavior because it allows us to share fragmented content more easily. If this behavior is not desired, you may use this attribute to disable this functionality.</li>
  <li><b>data-tab-vertical (Boolean, Optional) :</b> This attribute will change the tab interface from horizontal, the default, to vertical. When in vertical mode, the interface will behave differently. For example, focus will be placed on selected panel for improved accessibility.</li>
</ul>
