<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>data-tab-active (Number, Optional):</b> Using a number from "1" up, you can specify which tab and disclosure (accordion) should be active on page load. When this attribute is not specified, the first panel will be open by default. A tab or disclosure must always have at least one panel open. Having all disclosures collapsed in smaller viewports is <strong>not currently supported</strong>.</li>
  <li><b>data-tab-animation (Boolean, Optional) :</b> This attribute will enable animation of the content on page load and when tab or disclosure button is selected. You may customize the default CSS animation or keep what is currently in place.</li>
  <li><b>data-tab-breakpoint (String, Required):</b> Accepts any valid media query for more granular control over when interface needs to change from disclosure to tab and vice versa. Setting the breakpoint in code is important and allows us to pass in the needed roles and ARIA attributes for each interface type.</li>
  <!-- li><b>data-tab-callback (String, Optional):</b> You can use a callback to initiate a function within the disclosed content area on page load and reinitiate the same function on button click. The function will fire when any button in the grid disclosure is engaged with. The value of this data attribute should, of course, be the same as the function you wish to call</li -->
  <!-- li><b>data-tab-collapse (Boolean, Optional):</b> This attribute will ensure that all disclosures are closed. When this attribute is not specified, the first disclosure will be open bu default.</li -->
  <li><b>data-tab-disable-url (Boolean, Optional):</b> By default, the URL will always change to reflect selected page fragment. This is recommended behavior because it allows us to share fragmented content more easily. If this behavior is not desired, you may use this attribute to disable this functionality.</li>
  <li><b>data-tab-vertical (Boolean, Optional) :</b> This attribute will change the tab interface from horizontal, the default, to vertical. Placement of tabs on the right side of the the content is <strong>not currently supported</strong>. If buttons are moved to this position, keyboard arrow functionality will be reversed.</li>
</ul>
