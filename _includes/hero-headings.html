	<h2>Accessibility: Hero Banner Headings</h2>

  <p>Before using an <code>h1</code> heading in your hero banner, please make absolutely sure a heading is what you really need. Ask yourself these questions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is the hero banner meant as more of a call to action or branded message? If so, you may wish to treat the banner as decorative, in which case a <code>div</code> should be used instead of an <code>h1</code> or lower heading level.</li>
		<li>Is there another element on the page that is better suited to be a primary heading? Often, this will be <strong>below</strong> the hero banner. If so, <strong>this</strong> should be your <code>h1</code>.</li>
		<li>Think contextually. Often, the hero banner on the homepage could justifiably describe the overarching message of the site and be an <code>h1</code>, while hero banners on subpages may demand a <code>div</code>, especially if those suppages include a more suitable headings that can be your <code>h1</code>.</li>
  </ul>
